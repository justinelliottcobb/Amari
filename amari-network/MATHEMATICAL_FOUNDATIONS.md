## Clifford Algebra Foundations

### Definition

A Clifford algebra **Cl(P,Q,R)** over the real numbers is an associative algebra generated by an orthonormal basis {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ} where n = P + Q + R, subject to the relations:

- eᵢ² = +1 for i = 1, ..., P (positive signature)
- eᵢ² = -1 for i = P+1, ..., P+Q (negative signature)
- eᵢ² = 0 for i = P+Q+1, ..., P+Q+R (null signature)
- eᵢeⱼ = -eⱼeᵢ for i ≠ j (anti-commutation)

### Multivector Structure

A general multivector **M** in Cl(P,Q,R) can be written as:

```
M = α + Σᵢ αᵢeᵢ + Σᵢ<ⱼ αᵢⱼeᵢeⱼ + ... + α₁₂...ₙe₁e₂...eₙ
```

where:
- α is the scalar part (grade 0)
- αᵢeᵢ terms form the vector part (grade 1)
- αᵢⱼeᵢeⱼ terms form the bivector part (grade 2)
- etc.

### Geometric Product

The geometric product of two multivectors A and B is:

```
AB = A·B + A∧B
```

where A·B is the symmetric inner product and A∧B is the antisymmetric outer product.

### Norm and Distance

The norm of a multivector **M** is defined as:

```
||M|| = √(M†M)
```

where M† is the conjugate of M. This provides the geometric distance metric used in network analysis.

## Geometric Network Embedding

### Node Representation

Each node i in the network is represented as a multivector **mᵢ** ∈ Cl(P,Q,R). This embedding captures:

1. **Position information** through the vector part
2. **Orientation information** through bivector components
3. **Higher-order geometric properties** through higher-grade terms

### Distance Metric

The geometric distance between nodes i and j is:

```
d(i,j) = ||mᵢ - mⱼ||
```

This distance respects the geometric structure of the Clifford algebra and provides meaningful similarity measures.

### Advantage over Euclidean Embedding

Unlike traditional Euclidean embeddings, Clifford algebra embeddings:

1. **Preserve rotational structure** through bivector components
2. **Handle different geometries** (Euclidean, Minkowski, etc.) uniformly
3. **Encode orientation** and higher-order geometric relationships
4. **Provide natural similarity measures** via geometric products

## Tropical Algebra Theory

### Tropical Semiring

The tropical semiring (ℝ ∪ {-∞}, ⊕, ⊗) is defined with:

- **Addition**: a ⊕ b = max(a, b)
- **Multiplication**: a ⊗ b = a + b
- **Zero element**: -∞
- **One element**: 0

### Shortest Path Correspondence

In a weighted graph with adjacency matrix **W**, the shortest path distance matrix **D** satisfies:

```
D = W ⊕ W² ⊕ W³ ⊕ ... = W*
```

where W* is the tropical closure (Kleene star) of W.

### Floyd-Warshall in Tropical Algebra

The tropical Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes:

```
D[k][i][j] = D[k-1][i][j] ⊕ (D[k-1][i][k] ⊗ D[k-1][k][j])
            = max(D[k-1][i][j], D[k-1][i][k] + D[k-1][k][j])
```

### Computational Advantages

1. **Matrix operations**: Shortest paths reduce to tropical matrix multiplication
2. **Parallelization**: Independent operations can be computed in parallel
3. **Numerical stability**: Avoids precision issues with repeated additions
4. **Theoretical foundation**: Connects to convex geometry and optimization

## Geometric Distance Metrics

### Clifford Algebra Norm

For a multivector **M = M₀ + M₁ + M₂ + ... + Mₙ** where Mₖ is the k-grade component:

```
||M||² = |M₀|² + ||M₁||² + ||M₂||² + ... + ||Mₙ||²
```

The exact formula depends on the signature (P,Q,R):

- **Euclidean (P,Q,R) = (n,0,0)**: Standard Euclidean norm
- **Minkowski (P,Q,R) = (1,3,0)**: Spacetime-like norm
- **Conformal (P,Q,R) = (n,1,1)**: Conformal geometric norm

### Properties

1. **Triangle inequality**: d(i,k) ≤ d(i,j) + d(j,k)
2. **Symmetry**: d(i,j) = d(j,i)
3. **Non-negativity**: d(i,j) ≥ 0
4. **Identity of indiscernibles**: d(i,j) = 0 iff i = j

## Community Detection Theory

### Geometric Clustering

The geometric clustering algorithm minimizes the objective function:

```
J = Σᵢ Σⱼ∈Cᵢ ||mⱼ - cᵢ||²
```

where:
- Cᵢ is the i-th cluster
- cᵢ is the geometric centroid of cluster i
- mⱼ is the multivector representing node j

### Centroid Calculation

The centroid of a cluster C is:

```
c = (1/|C|) Σⱼ∈C mⱼ
```

This is the geometric mean in the Clifford algebra space.

### Spectral Clustering

The normalized Laplacian matrix is:

```
L = I - D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2)
```

where:
- A is the adjacency matrix
- D is the degree matrix
- I is the identity matrix

The eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues provide cluster assignments.

### Cohesion Score

The cohesion of a community C is defined as:

```
H(C) = |C|(|C|-1) / (2 Σᵢ,ⱼ∈C d(i,j))
```

Higher values indicate more cohesive communities.

## Information Diffusion Models

### Geometric Product-Based Diffusion

The transmission strength between nodes i and j is based on the geometric product:

```
T(i,j) = |⟨mᵢ, mⱼ⟩| / (||mᵢ|| ||mⱼ||)
```

where ⟨mᵢ, mⱼ⟩ is the scalar part of the geometric product mᵢmⱼ.

### Diffusion Equation

The information level at node i at time t+1 is:

```
Iᵢ(t+1) = δ Iᵢ(t) + α Σⱼ wᵢⱼ T(i,j) Iⱼ(t)
```

where:
- δ is the decay factor (0 < δ < 1)
- α is the diffusion rate (0 < α < 1)
- wᵢⱼ is the edge weight from j to i

### Convergence Analysis

The system converges when:

```
||I(t+1) - I(t)||₁ < ε
```

for some small threshold ε.

## Centrality Measures

### Geometric Centrality

For node i:

```
Cᵍᵉᵒ(i) = n / Σⱼ≠ᵢ d(i,j)
```

where n is the number of nodes. Higher values indicate more central positions in the geometric embedding.

### Betweenness Centrality

```
Cᵇᵉᵗ(i) = Σₛ≠ᵢ≠ₜ σₛₜ(i) / σₛₜ
```

where:
- σₛₜ is the number of shortest paths from s to t
- σₛₜ(i) is the number of shortest paths from s to t passing through i

### Tropical Betweenness Centrality

In the tropical setting, a node i lies on a shortest path from s to t if:

```
d(s,t) = d(s,i) ⊕ d(i,t)
```

where ⊕ is tropical addition (max operation).

where:
- V = number of vertices

### Stability Analysis

1. **Small perturbations** in node positions
2. **Edge weight variations** within reasonable bounds
3. **Signature changes** that preserve essential geometric properties
