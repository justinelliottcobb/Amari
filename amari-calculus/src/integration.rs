//! Integration on manifolds using geometric measure theory
//!
//! This module provides integration of scalar and multivector fields over
//! manifolds, using the measure-theoretic foundations from amari-measure.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! This module is a placeholder for future implementation.
//! Integration will use LebesgueIntegrator from amari-measure.

/// Placeholder for manifold integration functionality
pub struct ManifoldIntegrator;

// Future: Integration over manifolds, fundamental theorem verification, etc.
