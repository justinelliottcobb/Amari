//! Manifold calculus - covariant derivatives and connections
//!
//! This module provides tools for calculus on curved manifolds, including:
//! - Covariant derivatives
//! - Christoffel symbols and connections
//! - Metric tensors
//! - Geodesics (future)
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! This module is a placeholder for future implementation of manifold calculus.
//! Covariant derivatives on curved spaces will be added in later versions.

/// Placeholder for manifold calculus functionality
pub struct Manifold;

// Future: Connection, MetricTensor, CovariantDerivative, etc.
