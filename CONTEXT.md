## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Successful Design Patterns

1. **Type-Safe Generic Architecture**
   ```rust
   pub struct Multivector<const P: usize, const Q: usize, const R: usize>
   ```
   - Compile-time metric signature specification
   - Zero-cost abstractions for mathematical operations

2. **Trait-Based Mathematical Operations**
   ```rust
   pub trait FisherMetric<T: Parameter>
   pub trait AlphaConnection<T: Parameter>
   ```
   - Flexible, extensible mathematical interfaces
   - Generic over number types with appropriate constraints

3. **Unified Fusion System**
   ```rust
   pub struct TropicalDualClifford<T: Float, const DIM: usize> {
       pub tropical: TropicalMultivector<T, DIM>,
       pub dual: DualMultivector<T, 3, 0, 0>,
       pub clifford: Multivector<3, 0, 0>,
   }
   ```
   - Multiple mathematical views of the same data
   - Consistency validation across representations

### Current Technical Challenges

1. **Cayley Table Implementation**
   - Index bounds issues in geometric product computation
   - Need proper basis enumeration for arbitrary dimensions
   - Signature-dependent sign computation

2. **No-Std Compatibility**
   - `vec!` macro not available in `no_std` environment
   - Need systematic conversion to explicit `Vec::with_capacity()` calls
   - Affects tropical and dual number test modules

3. **Complex Rotor Operations**
   - Advanced methods (axis-angle, matrix conversion, interpolation) need refinement
   - Mathematical correctness vs numerical stability trade-offs
