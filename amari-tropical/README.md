# amari-tropical

Tropical (max-plus) algebra implementation for optimization and neural network applications.

## Overview

`amari-tropical` implements tropical algebra, also known as max-plus algebra, where the traditional operations (+, ×) are replaced with (max, +). This transformation converts expensive softmax and multiplication operations into simple max and addition operations, making it particularly useful for:

- Finding most likely sequences (Viterbi algorithm)
- Shortest path optimization
- Neural network inference optimization
- Dynamic programming

## Features

- **TropicalNumber**: Core scalar type with max-plus operations
- **TropicalMatrix**: Matrix operations in tropical algebra
- **TropicalMultivector**: Integration with geometric algebra
- **Viterbi Decoder**: Efficient sequence decoding using tropical operations
- **Tropical Polytopes**: Geometric structures in tropical space
- **High-Precision Support**: Optional extended precision arithmetic

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
amari-tropical = "0.12"
```

### Feature Flags

```toml
[dependencies]
# Default features
amari-tropical = "0.12"

# With serialization
amari-tropical = { version = "0.12", features = ["serialize"] }

# With GPU acceleration
amari-tropical = { version = "0.12", features = ["gpu"] }

# High-precision arithmetic
amari-tropical = { version = "0.12", features = ["high-precision"] }
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use amari_tropical::TropicalNumber;

// Create tropical numbers
let a = TropicalNumber::new(3.0);
let b = TropicalNumber::new(5.0);

// Tropical addition: max(3, 5) = 5
let sum = a.tropical_add(&b);
assert_eq!(sum.value(), 5.0);

// Tropical multiplication: 3 + 5 = 8
let product = a.tropical_mul(&b);
assert_eq!(product.value(), 8.0);

// Tropical identities
let zero = TropicalNumber::<f64>::tropical_zero(); // -∞ (additive identity)
let one = TropicalNumber::<f64>::tropical_one();   // 0 (multiplicative identity)
```

## Mathematical Background

### Tropical Semiring

In tropical algebra, we define:

| Standard | Tropical |
|----------|----------|
| a + b | max(a, b) |
| a × b | a + b |
| 0 (additive identity) | -∞ |
| 1 (multiplicative identity) | 0 |

### Why "Tropical"?

The name honors Brazilian mathematician Imre Simon, who pioneered this field. The algebra is particularly powerful because:

1. **Exponentiation becomes linear**: e^(a+b) → max(a, b) in log-space
2. **Products become sums**: Reduces computational complexity
3. **Softmax approximation**: max approximates log-sum-exp

### Applications

- **Viterbi Algorithm**: Find most likely state sequences in HMMs
- **Shortest Paths**: Tropical matrix multiplication solves all-pairs shortest paths
- **Neural Networks**: Approximate attention mechanisms efficiently
- **Optimization**: Linear programming in tropical geometry

## Key Types

### TropicalNumber<T>

```rust
use amari_tropical::TropicalNumber;

let x = TropicalNumber::new(2.5);

// Access the underlying value
let val = x.value();

// Tropical operations (take references)
let y = TropicalNumber::new(3.0);
let sum = x.tropical_add(&y);  // max(2.5, 3.0) = 3.0
let prod = x.tropical_mul(&y); // 2.5 + 3.0 = 5.5
```

### TropicalMatrix

```rust
use amari_tropical::TropicalMatrix;

// Create matrices for shortest path computation
let distances = TropicalMatrix::new(/* ... */);

// Tropical matrix multiplication gives shortest paths
let paths = distances.tropical_matmul(&distances);
```

### Viterbi Decoder

```rust
use amari_tropical::viterbi::ViterbiDecoder;

// Efficient sequence decoding using tropical algebra
let decoder = ViterbiDecoder::new(&transitions, &emissions);
let best_path = decoder.decode(&observations);
```

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `types` | Core tropical number, matrix, and multivector types |
| `viterbi` | Viterbi algorithm for sequence decoding |
| `polytope` | Tropical polytopes and geometric structures |
| `verified` | Phantom types for compile-time verification |
| `error` | Error types for tropical operations |

## Performance

Tropical algebra offers significant performance benefits:

- **O(n) vs O(n log n)**: Max operation vs softmax
- **No overflow**: Log-space operations avoid numerical issues
- **Parallelizable**: Element-wise max operations are embarrassingly parallel
- **GPU-friendly**: Simple operations map well to GPU architectures

## v0.12.0 API Changes

The API was updated in v0.12.0 for better encapsulation:

```rust
// Before (v0.11.x)
let a = TropicalNumber(3.0);
let sum = a.tropical_add(b);
let val = a.0;

// After (v0.12.0+)
let a = TropicalNumber::new(3.0);
let sum = a.tropical_add(&b);  // Now takes reference
let val = a.value();
```
