# Phase 4: GPU & WASM Verification Framework Planning

## Overview

Phase 4 addresses the **Herculean challenge** of extending formal verification to GPU (amari-gpu) and WebAssembly (amari-wasm) implementations. These environments present unique constraints that will likely complicate or render traditional phantom type verification approaches ineffective.

## Key Challenges Identified

### üñ•Ô∏è **GPU Verification Challenges (amari-gpu)**

#### Memory Model Complexities
- **Global vs Local Memory**: Phantom types may not translate across GPU memory hierarchies
- **Coalesced Access Patterns**: Verification contracts might conflict with optimal memory access
- **Thread Divergence**: Mathematical invariants become harder to maintain across divergent execution paths
- **Shared Memory Race Conditions**: Verification requires new approaches for concurrent access patterns

#### Execution Model Constraints
- **SIMT Execution**: Single Instruction, Multiple Thread execution complicates individual thread verification
- **Warp-level Operations**: Group operations may invalidate individual element contracts
- **Kernel Launch Overhead**: Verification checking could negate performance benefits
- **Device-Host Synchronization**: Phantom types may not survive GPU-CPU data transfers

#### Performance vs Verification Trade-offs
- **Register Pressure**: Additional verification data structures may limit occupancy
- **Branch Divergence**: Verification branches could cause performance degradation
- **Memory Bandwidth**: Verification metadata competes with computational data
- **Kernel Complexity**: Verification logic may exceed GPU architectural limits

### üåê **WASM Verification Challenges (amari-wasm)**

#### Runtime Environment Limitations
- **Linear Memory Model**: Phantom types may not map well to flat memory space
- **No Generics at Runtime**: WASM lacks native support for Rust's type system features
- **Limited Debugging**: Verification contract failures harder to diagnose in browser
- **Sandbox Restrictions**: Limited access to system-level verification tools

#### JavaScript Interop Complications
- **Type Erasure**: Phantom types lost at WASM-JS boundary
- **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript's dynamic nature conflicts with compile-time contracts
- **Async Execution**: Promise-based operations complicate synchronous verification
- **Garbage Collection**: JS GC may interfere with Rust verification assumptions

#### Browser Environment Constraints
- **Security Policies**: CSP and other policies may restrict verification approaches
- **Performance Monitoring**: Limited access to detailed performance metrics for verification
- **Memory Limits**: Browser memory constraints affect verification data structures
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Verification behavior may vary across browser engines

## Strategic Approaches for Phase 4

### üîÑ **Adaptive Verification Framework**

Instead of forcing phantom types into incompatible environments, develop:

1. **Runtime Verification**: Move some contracts from compile-time to runtime checking
2. **Selective Verification**: Enable/disable verification based on target platform
3. **Approximation Contracts**: Use statistical or sampling-based verification for GPU contexts
4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine compile-time contracts with runtime validation where needed

### üéØ **Target-Specific Strategies**

#### GPU-Specific Solutions
- **Kernel-Level Contracts**: Verify mathematical properties at kernel boundaries
- **Reduction-Based Validation**: Use GPU reduction operations for aggregate verification
- **Profile-Guided Verification**: Enable verification only in debug/testing modes
- **Memory Hierarchy Contracts**: Different verification levels for different memory types

#### WASM-Specific Solutions
- **Interface Contracts**: Focus verification at WASM module boundaries
- **JavaScript Bridge Validation**: Verify data integrity at language boundaries
- **Browser API Integration**: Use browser debugging APIs for verification support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Layer verification capabilities based on browser support
