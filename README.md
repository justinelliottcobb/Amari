# Amari

**Comprehensive Mathematical Computing Platform with Geometric Algebra, Differential Calculus, Measure Theory, Probability Theory, Functional Analysis, Algebraic Topology, Dynamical Systems, and Vector Symbolic Architectures**

A unified mathematical computing library featuring geometric algebra, differential calculus, measure theory, probability theory on geometric spaces, functional analysis (Hilbert spaces, operators, spectral theory), algebraic topology (homology, persistent homology, Morse theory), dynamical systems analysis (ODE solvers, stability, bifurcations, chaos, Lyapunov exponents), relativistic physics, tropical algebra, automatic differentiation, holographic associative memory (Vector Symbolic Architectures), optical field operations for holographic displays, term rewriting (ARS/TRS), and information geometry. The library provides multi-GPU infrastructure with intelligent workload distribution and complete WebAssembly support for browser deployment. The 0.24.0 cycle adds the agent-first `amari-discovery` runtime and canonical additive holographic `superpose`/`scale` operations while preserving the 0.23 exact rational, surcomplex, arbitrary-signature WASM, and rewrite foundations.

## v0.23.0 Highlights

- **`RationalSurreal`** in `amari-surreal` is now a stable exact rational scalar field backed by `BigRational`, going beyond the finite dyadic `ShortSurreal` layer. `ShortSurreal` remains the short/dyadic slice — it does not claim arbitrary rationals or the full surreal universe.
- **`amari-surcomplex`** is a new crate providing exact rational complex arithmetic over `RationalSurreal`. Division `1 / (1 + 1/2 i) = 4/5 - 2/5i` demonstrates why dyadic `ShortSurreal` coefficients are insufficient for surcomplex closure and rational scalars are needed.
- **Epsilon rational functions** are available behind `experimental-epsilon` in `amari-surreal` — polynomials and rational functions in a formal positive infinitesimal `ε`, ordered by asymptotic behaviour as `ε → 0⁺`. This is **not** a nilpotent-dual-number system. Puiseux series, Hahn series, and generalized ordered-series fields remain a future extension path, not implemented in v0.23.
- **`amari-wasm`** exposes `WasmRationalSurreal`, `WasmRationalSurcomplex`, and `WasmExperimentalEpsilonRational` to TypeScript, with dynamic WASM version-gating in the examples suite.
- **Arbitrary-signature WASM** — `WasmGenericMultivector(p, q, r)` lets users select any Clifford algebra signature at runtime. Operations for DIM ≤ 6 dispatch through a compile-time match table (84 signatures); larger dimensions fall back to a cached Cayley-table path. 8 fast-path aliases (`WasmMultivector300`, `210`, `310`, `200`, `030`, `410`, `500`, `110`) provide pre-built convenience for the most common physics/engineering signatures.
- **`amari-rewrite`** is a new crate providing foundational ARS/TRS term-rewriting with `Rewritable` traits, path replacement, substitution/matching, bounded inverse rewriting, anti-unification, and rule inference scaffolding. Experimental `neural`, `smt`, and `amari-network` feature gates offer rewrite-search guidance hooks.

## v0.24.0: Amari Discovery

The `amari-discovery` crate is the sole owner of the installed
`amari` command. It provides deterministic catalog exploration, bounded
read-only Rust/Cargo and npm TypeScript inspection, holographic candidate
recall, Pareto ranking, replayable integration plans, registered mathematical
probes, and shared human/JSON/NDJSON contracts.

From a source checkout, install and inspect the available surface with:

```bash
cargo install --path amari-discovery
amari capabilities
amari discover search tropical
amari inspect .
```

Discovery never edits inspected projects or runs their compilers, build
scripts, lifecycle scripts, arbitrary commands, providers, or network access.
See the [Amari Discovery Guide](docs/guide/amari-discovery.md) for the human and
agent loops, privacy boundary, probe isolation, catalog maintenance, and
release-status caveats. The workspace and catalogs are synchronized to 0.24.0;
source metadata alone is not proof of crates.io/npm publication, registry
installation, or the `v0.24.0` tag.

## v0.22.0 Highlights

- **`amari-cgt`** is now a first-class short combinatorial game theory crate with arena-backed games, canonicalization, outcome/comparison helpers, nimbers, bounded/exact layer generation, and growth-reporting utilities.
- **`amari-surreal`** is now a first-class short-surreal crate with exact dyadic arithmetic, numeric-game validation over `amari-cgt`, simplest-number construction, and game/value round trips for supported finite cuts.
- **`amari-enumerative`** includes an opt-in `cgt-bridge` feature for adapting CGT layer-analysis reports into enumerative growth summaries.
- **`amari-wasm`** exposes release-focused CGT/surreal bindings to TypeScript: `WasmCgtArena`, `WasmGameInspection`, `WasmDyadic`, and `WasmShortSurreal`.
- **Scope remains explicit**: the release is about short normal-play games and short surreal numbers; loopy games, misère play, thermographs, hyperreal analysis, symbolic infinite surreal universes, and surcomplex arithmetic remain deferred.

## v0.21.0 Highlights

- **`amari-tropical`** now has a clearer optimization-facing split between float max-plus carriers and an arena-backed ordinal substrate below `ε₀` via `OrdinalArena`, `OrdinalId`, `CnfTerm`, and `OrdinalWeight`.
- **`amari-dual`** now includes explicit `BranchPolicy` handling, `MultiDualNumber::variables(...)` seed helpers, and `StaticMultiDual<T, const N: usize>` for small hot loops.
- **`amari-wasm`** exposes the new tropical/dual extension surface to TypeScript: semiring folds, ordinal arenas/weights, branch-policy min/max, multi-dual seeding, and fixed-size `WasmStaticMultiDual2/3/4` wrappers.
- **Examples and API docs** now include release-focused `0.21.0` tropical/dual workflows across Rust and WebAssembly.
- **Scope remains explicit**: the ordinal layer does not claim broader transfinite arithmetic, `viterbi` and `polytope` remain float-specific, and `amari-dual` remains a forward-mode AD crate.

## v0.23.0 Rational Surreal & Surcomplex Extensions

The workspace now includes the exact rational surreal scalar layer, experimental epsilon rational functions, and the new `amari-surcomplex` crate:

- **`RationalSurreal`** in `amari-surreal`: exact rational scalar field bridging the gap between the dyadic `ShortSurreal` layer and full surreal generality. `ShortSurreal` remains the short/dyadic slice — it does not claim arbitrary rationals or the full surreal universe.
- **`amari-surreal` experimental-epsilon**: epsilon polynomials and rational functions in a formal positive infinitesimal `ε` (not nilpotent dual numbers; Puiseux/Hahn/generalized series deferred to future extensions)
- **`amari-surcomplex`**: exact rational complex arithmetic over `RationalSurreal`, separate crate from `amari-surreal`

At the umbrella-crate level these are exposed through optional features:

```toml
[dependencies]
amari = { version = "0.24.0", features = ["surreal", "surcomplex"] }
```

`surcomplex` implies `surreal`, which implies `cgt`. The `surreal` feature also gates `RationalSurreal` and the opt-in `experimental-epsilon` feature.

type Cl3 = Multivector<3, 0, 0>;

// Create basis vectors
let e1: Cl3 = Basis::e1();
let e2: Cl3 = Basis::e2();

// Geometric product: e1 * e2 = e1 ∧ e2 (bivector)

```rust
use amari_holographic::optical::{
    OpticalRotorField, GeometricLeeEncoder, LeeEncoderConfig,

### Key Types

```rust
// Multivector in Clifford algebra Cl(P,Q,R)
// P: positive signature, Q: negative signature, R: zero signature
Multivector<const P: usize, const Q: usize, const R: usize>

// Tropical numbers (max-plus semiring)
TropicalNumber<T: Float>  // Use TropicalNumber::new(value)

// Arena-backed ordinals below ε₀ and ordinal tropical weights
OrdinalArena              // Owns OrdinalId handles
OrdinalWeight             // Bottom-extended optimization carrier

// Dual numbers for automatic differentiation
DualNumber<T: Float>      // Use DualNumber::new(value, derivative)
BranchPolicy              // Explicit tie behavior for min/max branch points

// Multi-variable dual numbers
MultiDualNumber<T: Float>         // Heap-backed gradients; use MultiDualNumber::variables(...)
StaticMultiDual<T, const N: usize> // Inline fixed-size gradients for small hot loops

// Tropical-Dual-Clifford unified system
TropicalDualClifford<T: Float, const DIM: usize>

// Common algebras
type Cl3 = Multivector<3, 0, 0>;      // 3D Euclidean
type Spacetime = Multivector<1, 3, 0>; // Minkowski spacetime
type PGA3D = Multivector<3, 0, 1>;    // Projective Geometric Algebra
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Clifford Algebra Cl(P,Q,R)

- **P**: Basis vectors with e²ᵢ = +1 (positive signature)
- **Q**: Basis vectors with e²ᵢ = -1 (negative signature)
- **R**: Basis vectors with e²ᵢ = 0 (degenerate)

```
ab = a·b + a∧b      // Geometric product = inner + outer product
```

### Tropical Algebra (Max-Plus)

```
a ⊕ b = max(a, b)    // Tropical addition
a ⊙ b = a + b        // Tropical multiplication
```

`0.21.0` also adds a bounded ordinal substrate for optimization-oriented ranking:

- `OrdinalArena` interns canonical ordinals below `ε₀`
- `OrdinalWeight` extends those ordinals with a bottom element for impossible paths/states
- `best_weight` and `compose_weights` provide semiring-style selection and composition

Applications: Path optimization, sequence decoding, dynamic programming, ordinal ranking, and valuation workflows

### Dual Numbers

```
a + εb where ε² = 0
(a + εb) + (c + εd) = (a + c) + ε(b + d)
(a + εb) × (c + εd) = ac + ε(ad + bc)
```

`0.21.0` makes branch-sensitive behavior explicit with `BranchPolicy::{Left, Right, Average}` and adds fixed-size `StaticMultiDual<T, N>` carriers for small optimization loops.

Applications: Automatic differentiation, gradient computation, local sensitivity analysis, and browser-friendly optimization loops

### Information Geometry

- **Fisher Information Metric**: Riemannian metric on statistical manifolds
- **α-Connections**: Generalized connections parameterized by α ∈ [-1,1]
- **Dually Flat Manifolds**: Manifolds with e-connection (α=+1) and m-connection (α=-1)
- **Bregman Divergences**: Information-geometric divergences

## v0.12.0 Breaking Changes

Version 0.12.0 introduced significant API improvements for better encapsulation:

### TropicalNumber

```rust
// Before (v0.11.x)
let a = TropicalNumber(3.0);
let value = a.0;
let sum = a.tropical_add(b);

// After (v0.12.0+)
let a = TropicalNumber::new(3.0);
let value = a.value();
let sum = a.tropical_add(&b);  // Now takes reference
```

### DualNumber

```rust
// Before (v0.11.x)
let x = DualNumber { real: 3.0, dual: 1.0 };
let value = x.real;

// After (v0.12.0+)
let x = DualNumber::new(3.0, 1.0);
let value = x.value();
let deriv = x.derivative();
```
