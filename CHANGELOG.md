## [0.3.6] - 2024-01-10

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Disable duplicate release.yml workflow that was causing @amari/amari-wasm conflicts
- Fix deployment pipeline to use only publish.yml with correct @justinelliottcobb scope
- Eliminate workflow duplication that was overriding manual package name fixes

### Root Cause
- Two workflows (publish.yml and release.yml) both triggered on tag pushes
- release.yml used incorrect --scope amari, generating @amari/amari-wasm
- release.yml ran without manual package name correction
- This caused conflicting publishes and 404 errors

### Solution
- Disabled release.yml tag trigger to prevent conflicts
- Only publish.yml now handles deployment with proper scope and manual fixes

## [0.3.5] - 2024-01-10

### Fixed
- Remove problematic examples suite auto-update from CI/CD workflow
- Prevent git conflicts and failed PR creation in automated deployment
- Simplify CI/CD to focus on core deployment (crates.io + npm publish)

### Changed
- Examples suite updates now handled manually when needed
- CI/CD workflow streamlined to essential publishing steps only

## [0.3.4] - 2024-01-10

### Fixed
- Fix wasm-pack scope issue by manually correcting package name after build
- CI/CD now properly generates @justinelliottcobb/amari-wasm instead of @amari/amari-wasm
- Add comprehensive debugging output to track package.json generation and fixes

### Technical Details
- wasm-pack --scope flag doesn't work as expected with hyphenated crate names
- Manual Node.js script fixes package name post-build in CI/CD
- This resolves the 404 Not Found errors when publishing to npm registry

## [0.3.3] - 2024-01-10

### Fixed
- Fix CI/CD workflow to build WASM package directly instead of using artifacts
- Remove dependency on build-wasm job for npm publish to avoid package name conflicts
- Add debugging output to CI/CD to trace package.json generation
- Add wasm-pack optimization configuration

### Changed
- npm publish job now builds WASM package independently for cleaner package generation
- Enhanced CI/CD debugging for package name verification

## [0.3.2] - 2024-01-10

### Fixed
- Fix npm publish workflow to use wasm-pack generated package.json from pkg/ directory
- Remove redundant manual package.json from amari-wasm (wasm-pack generates its own)
- Correct package name references in CI/CD to use @justinelliottcobb/amari-wasm

### Changed
- CI/CD now publishes from amari-wasm/pkg/ instead of amari-wasm/
- Package version management now fully handled by wasm-pack from Cargo.toml

## [0.3.1] - 2024-01-10
