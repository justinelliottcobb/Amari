## 📋 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 4C.1: WASM Verification Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**

#### **Enhanced amari-wasm Crate**
- **Runtime Verification Contracts**:
  ```rust
  pub struct WasmVerificationContext {
      platform_capabilities: WasmPlatformProfile,
      verification_strategy: WasmVerificationStrategy,
      performance_budget: Duration,
      memory_constraints: WasmMemoryLimits,
  }
  ```

- **Browser Environment Detection**:
  ```rust
  pub enum WasmEnvironment {
      Browser { engine: BrowserEngine, features: BrowserFeatures },
      NodeJs { version: String, features: NodeFeatures },
      Standalone { runtime: WasmRuntime },
  }
  ```

- **Memory Management Integration**:
  ```rust
  pub struct WasmMemoryManager {
      heap_monitor: HeapUsageMonitor,
      gc_integration: GarbageCollectionHooks,
      allocation_tracker: AllocationTracker,
  }
  ```

#### **JavaScript Interop Verification**
- **Type-Safe Boundary Crossing**: Verification contracts for JS/WASM data exchange
- **Serialization Validation**: Mathematical property preservation across serialization
- **Error Propagation**: Unified error handling between JS and WASM contexts

### **Phase 4C.2: New Mathematical Domain Integration (Weeks 2-3)**

#### **New Crate Structure**
*[Pattern based on existing crates]*

### **Phase 4C.3: Cross-Platform Unification (Weeks 3-4)**

#### **Unified Verification API**
```rust
pub struct UnifiedVerifier {
    cpu_verifier: CpuVerifier,
    gpu_verifier: Option<GpuBoundaryVerifier>,
    wasm_verifier: Option<WasmVerificationContext>,
    platform_detector: PlatformDetector,
}

impl UnifiedVerifier {
    pub async fn verified_operation<T, R>(&mut self,
        operation: impl MathematicalOperation<T, R>
    ) -> Result<VerifiedResult<R>, VerificationError> {
        // Automatically select optimal verification strategy
        // based on current platform and operation requirements
    }
}
```

#### **Performance Monitoring Dashboard**
- **Real-time Metrics**: Verification overhead tracking across all platforms
- **Platform Comparison**: Performance profiling and optimization recommendations
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and compute utilization monitoring

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **WASM Verification Strategy**

#### **Runtime Contract Verification**
Unlike GPU boundary verification, WASM verification focuses on:
1. **Memory Safety**: Ensuring mathematical operations don't violate WASM memory constraints
2. **Numeric Precision**: Maintaining mathematical precision across JS/WASM boundary
3. **Performance Contracts**: Enforcing performance budgets in resource-constrained browsers
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Adapting verification based on browser capabilities

#### **Browser-Specific Optimizations**
```rust
pub enum BrowserOptimization {
    // Modern browsers with full WASM support
    FullWasm { simd_support: bool, threads_support: bool },
    // Older browsers with limited WASM features
    BasicWasm { memory_limit: usize },
    // Fallback to JavaScript implementation
    JavaScriptFallback { use_typed_arrays: bool },
}
```
