# v1.0.0 Release Notes

This is the first stable release of Amari, marking API stability for all public interfaces.

## Highlights

### Stability Guarantees

- All public APIs are now stable and follow semantic versioning
- Breaking changes will only occur in major version bumps
- Deprecated items will be maintained for at least one minor version

### New Crate: amari-dynamics

The v1.0.0 release includes the new `amari-dynamics` crate for dynamical systems analysis:

- **ODE Solvers**: RK4, RKF45, Dormand-Prince, Backward Euler
- **Stability Analysis**: Fixed points, linearization, eigenvalue classification
- **Bifurcation Theory**: Saddle-node, Hopf, pitchfork detection
- **Attractors**: Limit cycles, strange attractors, basin computation
- **Lyapunov Exponents**: QR-based spectrum computation
- **Phase Portraits**: Nullclines, trajectories, visualization support
- **Built-in Systems**: Lorenz, Van der Pol, Rossler, Duffing, Henon

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

- `amari-wasm`: 65+ tests covering all WASM bindings
- `amari-automata`: 55+ tests for cellular automata
- `amari-gpu`: 88 passing tests + 11 GPU-hardware tests

### Performance Benchmarks

Criterion benchmarks added to:
- `amari-dual`: Automatic differentiation operations
- `amari-tropical`: Tropical arithmetic and matrices
- `amari-calculus`: Differential operators
- `amari-functional`: Inner products and norms
- `amari-topology`: Simplicial complexes and homology

## Breaking Changes from v0.17.0

### API Changes

1. **TropicalMultivector**: Now requires 4 generic parameters `<T, P, Q, R>`
2. **Conversion utilities**: Moved to WASM bindings only
3. **max_element() / forward_mode_ad()**: Removed from public API

### Deprecations

None in this release.

## Known Issues

1. **Tropical network shortest path**: May hang on certain graph configurations (investigating)
2. **Geodesic integration precision**: Some edge cases need precision tuning
3. **SIMD optimizations**: Currently disabled pending stabilization
